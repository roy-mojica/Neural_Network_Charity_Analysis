# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Using machine learning and neural networks

## Overview of the analysis: 

Using machine learning and neural networks, I'll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results:
### Data Preprocessing

#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- IS_SUCCESSFUL
- 
#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- APPLICATION_TYPE
- AFFILIATION
- CLASSIFICATION
- USE_CASE
- ORGANIZATION
- STATUS
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
- ASK_AMT

#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- EIN
- NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
I chose to start off by using 

#### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
I was not able to achieve the target model performance of 75%. I was able to reach a performance of 55.51%, achieved during the initial analysis.
#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
